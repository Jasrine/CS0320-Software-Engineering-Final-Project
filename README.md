# term-project
Your project outline document is important for matching with a mentor TA, as well as developing an idea that can become a successful term project. You will write an outline document that lists each member of your team along with their strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, you will include a list of up to 3 project ideas, and detail their requirments.

The requirments section for each idea should describe what problems that ideas is attempting to solve and how your project will solve them. It should describe the critical features you will need to develop, why those features are being included, and what you expect will be most challenging about each feature.

Project ideas:
1. Movie suggester
The problem that we want to solve with this project is an that when people sit down to watch a movie, the suggestions based of a particular film seem limited and sometimes unrelated. Additionally, you can't get suggestions from multiple streaming services at once: if you're on Netflix you get Netflix's suggestions, if you're on Hulu, you get Hulu's suggestions, etc. There is no way to get suggestions regardless of streaming service, so we wanted to create a website that would do that.
    a. Critical features: Ability to get more movie suggestions based on a more specific query (ex: instead of simply horror movies, you could look up slasher horror or psychological horror), or based off a number of criteria instead of just one. Also a database of films, their genre/subgenera, maybe part of the script, etc.
    b. These features are being included because they are something that doesn't really exist for movie viewers. 
    c. Challenges: We'll have to use/find detailed descriptions of movies in order to be able to create some kind of database implement a search function. We also have to use a number of criteria to make similarity quantifiable, and we'll be making our own ranking system for that.

2. Game Engine
Problem to solve and how to solve it:
    a. Critical features: webGL API 
    b. These features are being included because some of us are interested in graphics and want to make a decent UI and have experience in webGL
    c. Challenges: improving on game engines that already exist
